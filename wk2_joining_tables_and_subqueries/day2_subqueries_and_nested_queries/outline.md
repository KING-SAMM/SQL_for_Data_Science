### Activities:
- Lecture: The instructor delivers a presentation on the concepts and types of subqueries.
- Discussion: Engage in a group discussion to clarify doubts and reinforce understanding.
- Examples and Case Studies: Work through real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the usage of subqueries.
- Hands-on Practice: Participants solve practice exercises using subqueries to retrieve specific data from given datasets.
- Query Optimization: Discuss techniques for optimizing queries with subqueries to improve performance.

### Assessment:
- Weekly Assessment: Participants are given a set of SQL queries involving subqueries to solve. They are evaluated based on the correctness of their queries and the accuracy of the results obtained.

### Resources:
- Lecture slides and materials on subqueries and nested queries.
- Practice datasets for hands-on exercises.
- Relevant SQL documentation and online resources for further reading and exploration.
