Objectives:

Understand the concept of joining tables in SQL
Learn about different types of joins, such as inner join and outer join
Practice writing queries that join two or more tables


Content:

1. Introduction to table joins:

Explanation of why and when table joins are necessary in data analysis.
Understanding the concept of primary and foreign keys in relational databases.


2. Inner join:

i. Definition of an inner join and its purpose in combining data from multiple tables.
ii. Syntax of the INNER JOIN clause and its usage in queries.
iii. Explanation of the matching criteria in an inner join.
Use of table aliases to simplify query writing.


3. Outer join:

Definition of outer joins, including left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join.

Comparison between outer joins and inner joins.
Handling NULL values in outer join results.


4. Join clause:

Syntax and usage of the JOIN clause in SQL queries.
Exploring additional options like CROSS JOIN and NATURAL JOIN.


5. Common join operators:

Equi-join: Explanation of equi-joins, which involve comparing columns with equal values.
Non-equi join: Introduction to non-equi joins, where columns are compared with inequality operators.
Self-join: Understanding self-joins, where a table is joined with itself.


Activities:

Query writing exercises:

Exercise 1: Joining two tables using an inner join and retrieving specific columns from both tables.
Exercise 2: Performing a left outer join between two tables and retrieving matching records from one table.
Exercise 3: Writing a query that includes a self-join to retrieve related information from a single table.
Hands-on practice:

Scenario: Given two tables, "Customers" and "Orders," students will write a query to retrieve customer information along with their corresponding orders.
Students will practice formulating the correct join conditions and selecting the desired columns from both tables.


Assessment:

Weekly assessment: Joining tables and subquery exercises.
Exercise 1: Write a query to join two tables using an inner join and retrieve specific columns from both tables.
Exercise 2: Perform a left outer join between two tables and retrieve matching records from one table.
Exercise 3: Write a query that includes a self-join to retrieve related information from a single table.
