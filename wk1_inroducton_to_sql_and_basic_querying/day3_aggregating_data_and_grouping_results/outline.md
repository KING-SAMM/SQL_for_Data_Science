Day 3: Aggregating Data and Grouping Results

In this session, we will learn how to summarize and analyze data using aggregate functions and the GROUP BY clause.

GROUP BY clause:
The GROUP BY clause is used in SQL to group rows with identical data into summary rows, like "find the total sales by country". The GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.

Aggregate Functions:
Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on groups of rows in a table. Common aggregate functions include:

COUNT(): counts the number of rows in a table or group
SUM(): calculates the sum of a column or group of columns
AVG(): calculates the average value of a column or group of columns
MIN(): finds the minimum value in a column or group of columns
MAX(): finds the maximum value in a column or group of columns
Practice Writing Queries with GROUP BY and Aggregate Functions:
We will practice writing queries that use the GROUP BY clause and one or more of the aggregate functions listed above to perform calculations on groups of rows in a table.

Activities:

Introduce the GROUP BY clause and aggregate functions.
Demonstrate how to use these functions in SELECT statements.
Give students exercises to practice writing queries with GROUP BY and aggregate functions.
Walk through the solutions to the exercises as a group.
