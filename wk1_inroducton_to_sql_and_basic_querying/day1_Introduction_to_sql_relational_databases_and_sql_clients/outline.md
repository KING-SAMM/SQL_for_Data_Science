Final Project:

For the final project, students will be given a dataset and asked to perform various SQL operations on it. They will be required to write complex SELECT statements with multiple JOIN clauses to retrieve data from multiple tables. They will also be required to use various aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG to perform calculations on the data. Finally, they will be asked to create views and stored procedures to automate certain tasks.

Summary:

In Week 1, Day 1 of the SQL for Data Science curriculum, students will be introduced to SQL, relational databases, SQL clients, and basic SQL syntax. They will learn how to write SELECT statements to retrieve data from a single table and how to filter data using WHERE clauses. They will also be introduced to database normalization and primary and foreign keys. The class will be supplemented with video tutorials and exercises to reinforce learning.
