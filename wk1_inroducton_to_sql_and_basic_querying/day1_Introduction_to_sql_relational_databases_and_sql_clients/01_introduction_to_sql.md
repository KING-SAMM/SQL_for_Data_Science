# Lesson 1. INTRODUCTION TO SQL

##WHAT IS SQL?
i. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is used for creating, modifying, and extracting data from databases. It provides a way to store and retrieve data in a structured and organized manner.

## BRIEF HISTORY OF SQL
ii. SQL was developed by IBM in the 1970s as a way to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases. The first version of SQL, called SEQUEL, was developed by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. It was later standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the late 1980s.

Since its development, SQL has become the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It has evolved over the years with various vendors implementing their own versions of SQL with extensions and variations to the standard.

##WHY IS SQL IMPORTANT FOR DATA SCIENCE?
iii. SQL is important for data science because it is the standard language used for managing and manipulating relational databases, which are a critical component of data storage and management in organizations. Data scientists need to be able to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently and effectively to carry out data analysis and derive insights from the data.

SQL provides a way to write queries to retrieve data from databases, join tables together, filter and sort data, and perform calculations and aggregations. Without SQL, data scientists would need to rely on manual manipulation of data, which would be time-consuming and error-prone. SQL is also essential for working with big data, as it provides a scalable and efficient way to process and analyze large datasets.
