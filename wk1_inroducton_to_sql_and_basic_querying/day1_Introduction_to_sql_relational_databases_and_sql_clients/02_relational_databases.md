# Lesson 2 
## RELATIONAL DATABASES

## What are relational databases?

***Relational databases*** are databases that organize data into one or more *tables*, where each table consists of a set of *columns* and *rows*. In a relational database, tables can be related to each other based on common fields, creating a relationship between them. This makes it easy to search, retrieve, and update data in a structured way.

## Basic structure of a relational database.

A relational database consists of one or more tables, where each table is made up of columns and rows. Columns represent the attributes or characteristics of the data being stored, while rows represent individual instances of data. Each row in a table is identified by a unique value in a column known as the ***primary key***.

## Understanding tables, rows, and columns.

In a relational database, a table is a collection of related data organized into columns and rows. Columns represent the attributes or characteristics of the data being stored, such as a person's name or age. Rows represent individual instances of the data, such as a specific person's name and age. For example, a table for a company's employees might have columns for first name, last name, employee ID, and job title, with each row representing a different employee.

## Primary and foreign keys.

In a relational database, a ***primary key*** is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This is typically a single column such as an ID number or a combination of columns. A ***foreign key*** is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table. This is used to create relationships between tables, allowing data to be connected and linked across multiple tables.

## Database normalization.

***Database normalization*** is the process of organizing the columns and tables in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones, creating relationships between tables, and ensuring that each table has a clear and specific purpose. Normalization helps to prevent data inconsistencies and anomalies, making it easier to maintain and update the database over time.
